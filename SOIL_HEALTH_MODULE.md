4. **Agroforestry**: Trees + crops for soil improvement, biodiversity
5. **Organic Farming**: Reduce chemical inputs, build soil health
6. **Integrated Pest Management**: Eco-friendly pest control
7. **Water Conservation**: Mulching, drip irrigation, rainwater harvesting
8. **Soil Amendments**: Lime for acidity, compost for fertility

### Land Restoration Features:
- Identify degraded land indicators
- Provide recovery timelines
