# Campaign Content Generation - Improvements

## Overview
Updated the campaign content generation to produce actual ready-to-publish campaign descriptions instead of guides or templates.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Enhanced AI Prompt** (`generateCampaignContent`)

#### Before
- Generated generic template-style content
- Included section headers and formatting instructions
- Produced guides rather than actual campaign text

#### After
- Generates **ready-to-publish campaign descriptions**
- Natural, flowing narrative style
- No markdown formatting or section headers
- Sounds like a real campaign announcement

### 2. **New Prompt Structure**

```javascript
const prompt = `You are writing a compelling campaign description for "${title}", 
a ${type} initiative in ${location}.

Campaign Details:
- Goal: Plant ${goal} trees
- Duration: ${duration} months
- Location: ${location}

Write an engaging campaign description that will inspire people to join.

Include these sections (WITHOUT section headers):
1. Opening paragraph: Inspiring introduction (2-3 sentences)
2. The Challenge: Environmental challenge being addressed (2-3 sentences)
3. Our Solution: How planting trees will help (2-3 sentences)
4. Get Involved: Call-to-action (1-2 sentences)

FORMATTING RULES:
- Write in natural, flowing narrative style
- Use simple paragraphs separated by blank lines
- NO markdown headings (no # symbols)
- NO bullet points or numbered lists
- NO bold or italic formatting
- Write as if speaking directly to potential volunteers
- Keep tone inspiring, positive, and action-oriented
- Make it sound like a real campaign announcement
```

### 3. **Content Cleaning**

Removes any accidental formatting that might slip through:

```javascript
const cleanContent = content
  .replace(/#{1,6}\s+/g, '')           // Remove heading markers
  .replace(/\*\*\*(.+?)\*\*\*/g, '$1') // Remove triple asterisks
  .replace(/\*\*(.+?)\*\*/g, '$1')     // Remove bold markers
  .replace(/\*(.+?)\*/g, '$1')         // Remove italic markers
  .replace(/^\d+\.\s+/gm, '')          // Remove numbered lists
  .replace(/^[-•]\s+/gm, '')           // Remove bullet points
  .trim()
```

### 4. **Improved Display Formatting**

#### Old Display
```html
<div class="bg-white rounded-lg p-4">
  <p class="whitespace-pre-line">${description}</p>
</div>
```

#### New Display
```html
<div class="bg-white rounded-lg p-6 max-h-64 overflow-y-auto">
  <div class="prose prose-sm dark:prose-invert">
    ${formatCampaignDescription(description)}
  </div>
</div>
```

### 5. **Formatting Helper Function**

```javascript
function formatCampaignDescription(description) {
  // Split into paragraphs and format
  const paragraphs = description
    .split('\n\n')                     // Split on double line breaks
    .filter(p => p.trim())             // Remove empty paragraphs
    .map(p => `
      <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed text-base">
        ${p.trim()}
      </p>
    `)
    .join('')
  
  return paragraphs
}
```

## Example Campaign Content

### Sample Output for "Green Valley Restoration"

**Type:** Reforestation  
**Location:** Nairobi, Kenya  
**Goal:** 5,000 trees  
**Duration:** 6 months

**Generated Description:**

```
Imagine the Green Valley once again thriving with lush forests, 
providing clean air, protecting our water sources, and creating 
a haven for wildlife. This is the vision driving our Green Valley 
Restoration campaign—a community-led effort to bring life back to 
our degraded landscapes.

For decades, deforestation and unsustainable land use have stripped 
Green Valley of its natural forest cover, leading to soil erosion, 
water scarcity, and loss of biodiversity. The effects are felt by 
every resident—from farmers struggling with poor soil quality to 
families facing unpredictable water supplies.

Over the next six months, we will plant 5,000 native trees across 
Green Valley, carefully selecting species that will restore the 
ecosystem, prevent erosion, and provide sustainable resources for 
our community. Each tree planted is a step toward a healthier 
environment and a more resilient future for generations to come.

Join us in this transformative journey. Whether you can plant a 
tree, donate to support the cause, or spread the word, your 
contribution matters. Together, we can restore Green Valley and 
create a legacy of environmental stewardship.
```
